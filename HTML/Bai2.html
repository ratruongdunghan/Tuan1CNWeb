                Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783)
            </h1>
            <p>
                The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century. <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel Switzeland, There, he studies under another giant
                of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathetics at St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler 
                was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was fekt in physics and 
                astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Intriduction in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well 
                over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une princess d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical 
                outline of the main physical theories of the time.

                One can hardly do math without coping Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps
best know for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula

                cos(x) + isin(x) = e^(ix)

                Leohard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps inimatched, adn ceretainly unsurpassed in the annals of mathematics.
